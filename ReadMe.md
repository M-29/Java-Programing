## Length Of Longest Substring
In this question we have taken a two pointer approach in which we have taken a character set and we are adding elements until we found duplicate once we found duplicate we will start removing elements from left until we are able to remove element present at right position. once it got deleted we will add element at right and calculate the max.

## Longest SubArray Of 1's After Deleting One Element
In this question we have used sliding window concept in which we are running the loop till length of the array in which we are incrementing the zeroleft pointer if zero found and running the loop if zeroleft is greater than 1 we are decremnting the zero left pointer if start pointer value is zero and increasing the start pointer and calculating the maximum lenght of subarray.
