## lengthOfLongestSubstring
In this question we have taken a two pointer approach in which we have taken a character set and we are adding elements until we found duplicate once we found duplicate we will start removing elements from left until we are able to remove element present at right position. once it got deleted we will add element at right and calculate the max.
